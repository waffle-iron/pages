The *Pages Package* contains pages that don't require too much functionality of their own. Most of their business logic is taken care of in the controller.

The following pages are currently included:
- [`HomePage`](https://github.com/unkso/pages/blob/master/files/lib/page/HomePage.class.php) - Landing page of the website
- [`NewsPage`](https://github.com/unkso/pages/blob/master/files/lib/page/NewsPage.class.php) - Shows news from forum posts
- [`TimelinePage`](https://github.com/unkso/pages/blob/master/files/lib/page/TimelinePage.class.php) - The clan's timeline
- [`StreamersPage`](https://github.com/unkso/pages/blob/master/files/lib/page/StreamersPage.class.php) - A list of clan streamers
