                            <p class="marginBottom">Probationary Enlisted are those new members of Unknown Soldiers who have just joined and are still going through Basic Combat Training (BCT). They have access to all clan resources and are expected to carry themselves as Unknown Soldiers at all times. How they do so is part of their probationary period, and failure to meet the expectations of their COC and clan wide regulations may result in their application being denied. Probationary Enlisted may not join any MOS or take any leadership position, but are always welcome to ask any questions about any aspect of the clan to gain a better understanding of where they may be of assistance or wish to contribute.</p>

                            <p class="marginBottom">The E-3 and E-4 enlisted ranks comprise the majority of the Unknown Soldiers. It is at these ranks where you are best positioned to demonstrate to your COC that you wish to advance. You may choose to remain at E-3 indefinitely. There is no retribution and will never be any punishment for this as long as you attend mandatory events and always stay in contact with your COC. You are a valued member of the clan regardless of whether you specifically wish to advance or be promoted. For those who wish to actively contribute, you should plan on attending NCO Academy and consider joining an MOS. You should also inform your COC where your interests lie or if you think you could contribute to the clan in a specific way.</p>

                            <h3 class="big">NCO</h3>
                            <p class="marginBottom">As an NCO, you have demonstrated that you are willing to step up and take a leadership position within the Unknown Soldiers. NCOs are the backbone of the clan. You are in charge of a specific unit or platoon size group of members. This means you are responsible for them in every way. You are there to make sure they keep up morale as well as make sure they understand and execute their responsibilities and duties. If they express an interest in moving up, you are there to guide them in determining how they can best advance and contribute.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">Apart from your duties within your branch COC, your primary role as an NCO is to enforce regulations and help other members understand how to better uphold those regulations. This is everything from on-the-spot corrections for cursing, lack of customs and courties, and in-game infractions, to making sure someone is turning in reports on time or attending mandatory events.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">By E-6, you must specialize as either moving toward Command or Staff/Technical ranks. Command focuses on helping leadership direct the whole branch and maintaining activity and morale. You are expected to maintain excellent attendance at events and you set the example for your troops. Staff/Technical focuses on the logistical aspects such as recruiting and training. You get a little bit of latitude on attendance, but you must make up every bit of that in dedication to your duties within Intel. Both specilizations are critical to maintaining an active and well run clan.</p>

                            <h3 class="big">Senior NCO</h3>
                            <p class="marginBottom">Senior NCO's are the role models and up and coming leaders of the clan. It is on you as a Senior NCO to set the example and make sure NCO's under you are upholding their responsibilities to the branch and as NCO's. You are in a position to help run and guide your branch, and in doing so impact the whole clan. You have demonstrated an ability to direct your troops and are being prepared to take over higher leadership positions.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">Moving up as a Senior NCO is entirely dependent on position availability, your ability and dedication, how you discharge your duties as an NCO, and whether you support your COC both above and below your position.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">It is possible to switch between Command and Staff/Technical ranks/positions, but only if you meet the eligibility requirements. As a Senior NCO, you should be able to fill in wherever necessary, but if it is outside of your qualified specialization then you may be placed in an Acting capacity. Within your specialization, you must continue to show dedication to your troops, stay active, and always help out your branch leadership wherever possible.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">Not every branch has a Staff/Technical rank at E-6 through E-8. In these cases, you would take the available rank at your paygrade, and your promotion eligibility would still be based on Staff/Technical qualifications.</p>

                            <h3 class="big">Clan NCO</h3>
                            <p class="marginBottom">The Clan SMA is the senior most NCO in the clan. He reports directly to the Clan CO and XO, and is in charge of all NCO's throughout the clan. All branch E-8's report to him for NCO matters in addition to their branch COC. His role is to bridge the gap between officers and NCO's. He is the spokesman for all enlisted to all officers, from Warrants and Lieutenants all the way to the Clan CO and XO.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">While the SMA typically coordinates with the branch E-8s to direct their NCOs, his authority extends to all enlisted. Enlisted of any rank also have access to approach the Clan SMA directly if necessary. Circumstances warranting this include problems with the COC, an issue with ANY officer, real life sensitive issues that they do not feel comfortable simply passing up the COC, or harrasment from any other member. All members are encouraged to approach the SMA with any of these problems if they feel their COC cannot address it.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">The role of the SMA is to make sure that NCO training is taking place properly, that NCO's are discharging their responsibilities, and that at all times the regulations are being upheld. He is always involved and informed when there is disciplinary action between any officer and any NCO.</p>

                            <p class="marginBottom">Basic through Master III qualifications only count toward Staff/Technical points when issued by NONCOM. For all other Intel departments, you must be a Trainer, TOD, NCOIC, or Department NCOIC for it to count toward Staff/Technical eligibility. For all Trainer, ToD, and NCOIC positions, the member must currently be active in that role when up for promotion and in good standing with that dept in order to get credit towards promotion. Example: you are the NCOIC of a Combat MOS. However, your Dept NCOIC or WOIC does not believe you are living up to your responsibilities. It is their decision (with justification) that you would or would not get credit for being NCOIC.</p>

                            <p class="marginBottom">The diagram below illustrates the expected ranks for each branch enlisted position. There can be exceptions to this structure in rare circumstances. However, this is the normal progression that all members actively interested in promotion should expect to follow.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">The unit names pictured are structured around the Marines naming conventions. However, the overall unit layout within every branch is standard so there are only differences in rank abbreviation or specific unit names. In all branches there are &quot;Squad Level&quot;, &quot;Platoon Level&quot;, and &quot;Leadership&quot; level units.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">Notice there is a lot of flexibility as far as what ranks and specializations may actually fill a position. However, also note that quite often a member will only be able to take on a position in an "Acting" capacity if it is out of their specialization. Members should always strive to excel in their own area, but should always be mindful that they may be called upon to fill in elsewhere. It helps your chances of advancement if your leadership knows you are ready and willing to help wherever necessary.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">The goal of this specialized structure is to help members determine where they operate best within the clan, and to give them every opportunity to succeed without having to follow only one route to leadership. Because the clan is split between Division and Intel, they are equally viable as routes to advancing in rank. The most important rule while deciding where your specialization is and where you are most successful, is always take care of those under your command while proactively searching for ways to help those above you.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">The biggest limiting factor to advancing through this structure is whether you are already engaged in multiple duties. We never encourage members to take on more than one or two responsibilities at a time. Not only does it make "burning out" more likely, it can lead to disinterest in the clan game and lower the quality of work done in any single area. From the clan-wide perspective, we try to limit how many roles people take on in order to give as many as possible a fair chance to advance if they are interested and able. If too few people are holding too many positions, there are not as many slots for others looking for an opportunity to take on responsibilities.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">As you advance through the ranks, you will have more and more members who count on you for excellent leadership and initiative. This is not simply to accrue authority, but rather to position yourself to put your skills and your talent to good use for the benefit of the whole clan. Those above you will always be looking for you to step up to more responsibility as they see you are interested and engaged in your duties. Likewise, they will hold you to a higher and higher standard. If you fail to live up to the fair expectations of your own commanders, you should expect that you may not keep your rank and position. This should not be taken personally, but rather should be taken as an opportunity to learn where you need to grow as a member, and may even redirect you down another path that better suits you in the clan.</p>
                            <p class="marginBottom">Remember, whether you are a Junior NCO just starting to climb the ranks or the 1stSgt of your branch, you have been selected to fill your position because someone above you trusts in your abilities and your dedication to the clan. We do not place this trust lightly, and every day you should strive to live up to the goals of your current position before seeking advancement.</p>
