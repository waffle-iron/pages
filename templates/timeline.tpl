                            <p>JCS restructures to be more in alignment with real life Joint Chief layout. Clan CO and XO now have a Senior Enlisted Advisor (SEA; SMA.VicVegas) as well as a Chief Advisor (CW5.Ward) dedicated to their personal staff. Support Command and Division Command are completely removed from the Chain of Command so the Division CO and Intel CO report directly to the Clan CO/XO. NCOA moves out of Intel and reports directly to the SEA. Joint Staff is implemented to address clan logistics and planning. Members of the new JS are Branch XOs and Intel Dept WOICs.</p>
